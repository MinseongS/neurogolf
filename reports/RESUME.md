# RESUME — restart the autonomous sweep in a fresh session

## Step 0 — environment check (do this FIRST; the loop breaks without it)
```
ls /tmp/arc-gen/tasks | wc -l        # must be ~901. If MISSING (reboot clears /tmp):
tar xzf ~/.neurogolf-arc-gen.tar.gz -C /tmp     # restore the generators (no git remote exists for them)
ls .venv/bin/python                  # repo venv (onnx/onnxruntime/numpy)
ls /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/kaggle   # kaggle CLI
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python reports/lb_status.py    # prints current stored / confirmed LB / gap / PROJECTED LB
```
`reports/arc_mapping.json` hardcodes absolute `/tmp/arc-gen/...` paths, so the restore MUST land there.

## Step 1 — paste this CANONICAL loop prompt (reads live state from files; no stale counters)
```
/loop Autonomous NeuroGolf sweep (read reports/SWEEP_SYSTEM.md, STRATEGY_7500.md, BUILD_PROMPT.md first).
Each iteration: (0) `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python reports/lb_status.py` — note stored/proj-LB/gap (gap ~61.3
stable; if it grows after a submit, wins aren't translating). (1) check completed build agents; adopt via
`python -m src.adopt N` ONLY if generalizes AND beats current by >=+0.3 stored (else mark skip-marginal +
log insight); ignore duplicate notifications for already-adopted tasks; salvage a died-agent's leftover file
through the same gate (reject if worse). (2) mem_profile adopted nets; if mem>>tier floor queue a re-attack.
(3) update reports/tasklog/taskNNN.md + reports/sweep_ledger.json. (4) git commit each win AND `git push origin main` (remote = github.com/MinseongS/neurogolf, already configured); graduate reusable
insights into reports/BUILD_PROMPT.md. (5) read reports/lb_anchor.json for the last submit anchor; if a
submission is PENDING poll `kaggle competitions submissions -c neurogolf-2026`, and on COMPLETE record
reports/submission_log.md + rewrite lb_anchor.json (stored_at_submit, lb, time). (6) when current stored
exceeds lb_anchor.stored_at_submit by ~>=8 (≈5 wins), pack() + kaggle submit + poll + re-anchor. (7) dispatch
next 2-3 build agents (short prompt: "Read reports/BUILD_PROMPT.md and follow it INCLUDING anti-stall; TASK
N=<n> P=<pts>" + the entry-hypothesis sketch from reports/retriage_build_queue.json) — PICK next targets =
highest-gain entries in reports/retriage_build_queue.json whose sweep_ledger status is NOT done/confirmed-
infeasible (re-triage est is OPTIMISTIC & ~25% false-positive — trust adopt), then sweep_wave_queue.json
(21,42), then refill from sweep_ledger lowest-points non-bail pending. Skip confirmed-infeasible. GUARDRAILS:
Kaggle submit authorized every ~5 wins (never lose standing, best kept); auto-commit; max 2-3 concurrent
agents (if agents repeatedly STALL at 600s = env degraded → back off, retry ONE later, STOP after 4
consecutive failures and report); skill-creator only if a judgment-heavy procedure recurs (don't force).
Stop when the retriage_build_queue feasible set is exhausted + no productive work, or user interrupts.
kaggle CLI: /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/kaggle.
```

## State is fully in the repo (committed) + project memory — source of truth, not the prompt:
- reports/sweep_ledger.json — 1→400 status (done / retriage-feasible / pending-retry / confirmed-infeasible)
- reports/retriage_build_queue.json — ~42 remaining feasible targets ranked by est gain
- reports/lb_anchor.json — last confirmed submit (re-anchored each submit); lb_status.py projects from it
- reports/submission_log.md — LB history (6384.61→6393.20→6400.24→6406.72→6409.40→6419.29, all proj ±0.01)
- reports/{SWEEP_SYSTEM,STRATEGY_7500,BUILD_PROMPT}.md — system, 7500 ceiling analysis, build protocol
- reports/tasklog/taskNNN.md — per-task insight logs

## TWO BIG REOPENED RESERVOIRS (discovered 2026-06-16 afternoon) — work these, NOT just the curated queue:
1. **UNTRIAGED PENDING POOL**: `sweep_ledger.json` has ~270 low-score `pending`/`uncertain` tasks the
   re-triage never examined. These have REAL HEADROOM (just under-golfed public nets), NOT all walls.
   Proven: 088 13.85→15.53, 070 13.90→16.25, 238 13.93→15.34, 011 14.12→15.94, 037 14.12→14.84,
   328 14.28→14.94 — ~6/8 probes were wins. PROBE lowest-points-first WITH the EARLY FEASIBILITY CHECK
   (bail fast on variable-size flood / global-argmax walls). Refill source = step 7 tertiary.
2. **⭐ GAP-CLOSING on NON-GENERALIZING base nets** (highest value): the 61.27 stored−LB gap is mostly a
   handful of base nets with HIGH stored but fresh-rate 0.00 → they score ~0 on the real LB. `src/adopt.py`
   ALREADY counts the current net as 0 pts when it fails fresh, so ANY generalizing custom you build for
   them is adopted and raises LB by ~its full score (even at low stored). See `reports/lb_status.md` gap
   attribution table. TOP TARGETS: **219 (stored 15.00, fresh 0.00 → ~+15 LB)**, **255 (13.95, 0.00 →
   ~+14 LB)**, then 209/118/2/90/157/366/251/18/101 (partial, fresh 0.88-0.97, +0.3-1.7 each). These were
   mislabeled "confirmed-infeasible" by judging +0.3 against the INFLATED stored — IGNORE that label and
   build a generalizing exact encoding. This alone is worth ~+25 LB from 219+255.

## Honest status (2026-06-16, mid-session)
Confirmed LB **6453.40** (session start 6419.29, +34.11; this run opened the pending pool + gap-closing).
27 wins adopted this session, 9 submissions, all proj-exact (gap pinned 61.27). Run MORE AGGRESSIVELY:
5-6 concurrent agents OK (env healthy, 1 isolated hard-task stall in ~35 agents). A deep-research agent is
investigating the fundamental ~16.3 floor (the [1,1,30,30] fp32 colour-plane that ORT won't let go sub-fp32)
→ see reports/FLOOR_RESEARCH.md when it lands. Instruct stuck agents to go LOW-LEVEL: web-search ORT op
semantics, test quant/cast/integer ops, boldly re-encode heavy layers. Never let score drop (adopt gate +
Kaggle-keeps-best guarantee this).
